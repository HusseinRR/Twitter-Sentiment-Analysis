Objectives: 
Research the internet for potential interesting models and how to train them properly
Try some code...
Learn the difference between structured and unstructured text data
Shift your focus to sentimental analysis



Site for purchasing data esg oriented: (price around 250 dollars) id we decide to fine-tune

An intern describes his work experience at parabole.ai where he developed ESG-BERT by
further pre-training Google’s “BERT” language model on large unstructured Sustainability text corpora.

Very interesting approach, there's a need to understand some key concepts the intern used in his work
Worth testing

Idea to be discussed with Alexander: 
Three steps algorithm: (reliable or non-reliable news) -> (Categorize into a certain label) -> (sentiment analysis + or -)
Original BERT model:
https://github.com/google-research/bert : This is implemented in TensorFlow however
There are equivalents on HuggingFace


6 pretrained models for text classification:

How to deal with many laguages:
Relying on translation motors could be a possibility

Another interesting model to classify data into one of the three categories(E,S or G):
