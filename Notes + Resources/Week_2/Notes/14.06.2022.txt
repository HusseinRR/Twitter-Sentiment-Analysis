Part 1: Simple Value Chain

We'll start by implementing a simple value chain
Create a small set of tweets about an enterprise -> Filter ESG ones useing FinBERT -> analyse sentiment using bert
The model will be implemented in Simple_model.ipynb
The model gave some interesting results, it's an optimistic start. Nonetheless, it is to be taken into consideration that 
the model was taken as it is without ant finetuning and it was kind of tested with a very limited dataset.
Next we'll try to look into the training process, maybe find some datasets todo so.

Interesting article to share on linkedin with the right text to do so.


Part 3: Research Kaggle foe training datasets

Found this on kaggle: 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tunguz/envThe World Bankâ€™s ESG Data Draft dataset provides information on 17 key sustainability
themes spanning environmental, social, and governance categories.
This link (along with the notebook tweets.ESG) give us an approach to collect ESG tweets for example
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nederbouchnak/esg-tweets
I'll merge the content from this notebook with the simple model to improve its performance
The model gave interesting results, next step is to keep the research
