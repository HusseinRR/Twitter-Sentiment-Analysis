Goals:
Finish the youtube videos & Try implementing the youtube code
Research Ordinal Categorical Classification (ehen two classes are close to each other)
Research on finetuning RoBERTa and XLNet
Research text clustering if it's interesting for our model
Prepare a presentation of this week's findings


Finish the youtube videos & Try implementing the youtube code
We cloned the repository for the finetuning of bert_case. The sentiment_analysis_with_Bert notebook provides a good
struture to adopt for the work.


Research Ordinal Categorical Classification (when two classes are close to each other)
The idea: 
Instead of having a k-classifier we use k binary classifiers each prediction the prbability of being superior to a 
certain scale (form 1 to 5 for example)
We finally use the rule:
P(y=x) = P(y>=x) - P(y>=x+1)
Could be interesting to implement in our model 


Research on finetuning RoBERTa and XLNet
We'll continue with Day_3 work
